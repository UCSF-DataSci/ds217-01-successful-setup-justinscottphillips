# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
[Tell us a bit about yourself - your field of study, professional background, interests, or anything else you'd like to share]
Hi! I’m Justin, a second-year student in the Clinical Research Master’s program. My clinical background is in respiratory therapy, and I currently work at San Francisco General Hospital. I’m especially interested in the intersection of clinical research and data science, blending traditional epidemiologic methods for problem solving and investigation with technology and innovation, particularly in critical care and pulmonary medicine. I’m a San Francisco native and spend much of my free time traveling.

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
[What do you hope to gain? Specific skills, knowledge, applications, career goals?]
Over the past year, I’ve picked up some programming skills in R, and now I’d like to expand my knowledge into other widely used languages. Since I’m interested in both academic and industry applications, I’ve been told that learning Python would be especially useful. Long term, I hope to integrate clinical research, data science, and my clinical role into a career that bridges these areas.

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
[What excites you about programming/data science? What concerns or uncertainties do you have?]
I’m excited by how data science can help answer important clinical questions, using information and technology to improve and optimize clinical decision making. My main concern is that my background is primarily clinical, so computer science and programming are still relatively new to me. I’m working hard to get up to speed and build a stronger foundation.

## 4. Share something you enjoy!
[Drop a link to something you really enjoy - could be a website, article, video, project, hobby, book, podcast, or anything else you're into]
I often listen to the New Engalnd Journal of Medicine AI podcast during my commute (https://ai-podcast.nejm.org). I find it an interesting way to stay on top of how AI is being applied to healthcare and to hear clinicians’ stories about how they found their way into AI research or industry roles.
